Previously explored features include mainly structured information, such as sociodemographic data, comorbidity codes and physiological variables. In this paper we assess incorporating additional clinically interpretable NLP-based features such as topic extraction and clinical sentiment analysis to predict early readmission risk in psychiatry patients.","tags":[],"title":"Assessing the Efficacy of Clinical Sentiment Analysis and Topic Extraction in Psychiatric Readmission Risk Prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559275200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559275200,"objectID":"a518097d90871df0af4d168cc8912a47","permalink":"/project/figurativelanguage/","publishdate":"2019-05-31T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/figurativelanguage/","section":"project","summary":"A project on annotation and classification of non literal tweets.

A partir de este corpus, se han obtenido distintas medidas de riqueza por décadas (variación, densidad léxica y complejidad de los artículos) y se han comparado los valores obtenidos en las distintas épocas. Los resultados muestran que la riqueza y la complejidad de los textos periodísticos se han mantenido notablemente estables en los últimos cien años.","tags":[],"title":"Aracne: estudio de la variación lingüística en la prensa española entre 1914 y 2014 (Aracne: a study of language change in the Spanish press between 1914 and 2014)","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"   ","date":1516770000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1516770000,"objectID":"3ed8ba2828c135c15c31bc773b1f2093","permalink":"/talk/valladolid/","publishdate":"2018-01-24T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/valladolid/","section":"talk","summary":"Acceptance speech for the [Miguel Delibes National Journalism Award](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premio_Nacional_de_Periodismo_Miguel_Delibes) 2017.
